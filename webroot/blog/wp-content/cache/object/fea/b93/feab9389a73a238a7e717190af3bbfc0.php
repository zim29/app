<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Google Consent Mode V2: Background</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To properly understand Google Consent Mode V2, it is essential to review various concepts and backgrounds of this tool, including the Consent Mode, the European regulations for data protection, and the first version of Google Consent Mode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Google Consent Mode?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google Consent Mode is a mechanism implemented in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) that allows companies to transmit consent signals through their cookie consent banner. This process ensures that user preferences are respected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially, this consent mode allows you to determine whether or not your website visitors agreed to share their data for advertising, measurement, and personalization purposes. When a user gives consent, Google will use this mechanism to collect detailed information and analysis. On the contrary, if the user does not consent, Google will limit the use of cookies and identifiers to comply with their preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Google Consent Mode and its evolution: Influence of European legislation</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first version of Google Consent Mode was introduced in 2020 to allow data collection for Google Analytics and Google Ads while respecting the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This European legal regulation aims to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the European Union (EU) and states that website owners or business operators are responsible for how they collect and process users' data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In May 2023, the Digital Market Act (DMA) came into force. It transferred these responsibilities to significant technology companies by requiring explicit consent from users to be obtained for collecting and using European citizens' data for operations such as advertising or research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To adapt to this change, Google updated Consent Mode V1 to version 2, whose adoption in the EU and EEA is mandatory from March 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, let's look at the main features of Google Consent Mode v2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key features of Google Consent Mode v2</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google Consent Mode v2 has unique features, making it an advanced solution for managing user privacy and consent in the digital world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This tool stands out for its ability to integrate with other Google tools, such as Google Analytics, allowing user consent preferences to be managed in a way that respects their privacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most notable functions of Google Consent Mode v2 is its ability to recover conversion data even when approximately 65% of users have not consented, which is crucial for performance analytics without compromising user privacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This tool also uses probability and machine learning techniques, allowing you to apply basic and advanced models for data modeling. This means you can better predict and understand user behavior while respecting their privacy choices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another significant advancement is the increase in parameter collection, which now includes new parameters such as ad_user_data and ad_personalization. These are added to existing ones, such as ad_storage and analytics_storage, thus expanding the tool's ability to collect valuable information for advertisers and analysts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also important to understand the particularities of each of the modes of operation of Google Consent Mode v2, since each of them can offer different approaches and levels of data management based on user consent.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Implementing Google Consent Mode v2, users can choose between basic and advanced modes. Each offers different functionality and data handling levels, suitable to meet websites' specific privacy and data analysis needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Basic Mode</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The primary mode is the default setting that blocks all Google tags until the user explicitly consents to tracking. This mode ensures no data from users who decline tracking is processed, facilitating legal compliance with strict regulations such as GDPR.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this results in information not being collected from users who do not opt-in to tracking, which can result in an incomplete view of overall site behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advanced Mode</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advanced mode allows for collecting anonymous and aggregated data, even if the user has not consented to tracking cookies. This includes general information about device type, conversion, time range, and approximate location, allowing for more accurate data modeling without compromising user privacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both modes respect user consent decisions and are designed to balance regulatory compliance needs with digital advertising and analytics capabilities. The choice between one or the other will depend on the priority given to collecting modeled data and its value for the organization, always considering the legal and privacy implications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's now look at the fundamental details of how Google Consent Mode v2 works and the differences from its previous version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does Google Consent Mode v2 work?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google Consent Mode v2 works by collecting consented data based on four parameters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we mentioned above, v1 had two consent parameters:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>ad_storage: Specific for marketing aimed at cookies and their storage or non-storage on the server.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Analytics_storage: Activate or deactivate the storage of cookies related to analysis, statistics, and performance (duration of visits, number of visitors, number of pages viewed, etc.).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that this version could only signal to Google whether a user agreed or disagreed with cookies being set for analytical or marketing purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Google Consent Mode v2, Google added two new consent signals dedicated to audience building and remarketing:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>ad_user_data: refers to permissions to send and share user data with Google for advertising and remarketing purposes using cross-site identifiers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>ad_personalization: relates to consent to personalize ads based on user data (a crucial feature for feeding your audience lists!).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the user does not grant these two new parameters, Google will not be able to create specific audiences or serve personalized ads in the EEA region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When looking at these new options, it's clear that Google has made Consent Mode v2 a requirement. This means that those who work in digital marketing or own a website will need to collect consent from visitors and users and send those signals to Google. Guess what? Since March 2024, this can only be done through Consent Mode V2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, collecting any data, even anonymized data, from users who refuse consent can lead to legal complexities. This raises privacy concerns, as some people may consider any data collection without consent as a violation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, implementing this modality increases organizations' dependence on Google for information and analysis, which can limit transparency and control over their data. Moreover, the estimates provided by Google may need to be more accurate, especially with small or biased data sets.</p>
